# Image-classification-using-ML
#Overview
This repository contains an implementation of image classification using various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and MobileNet architectures. The goal is to classify images into different categories using advanced deep learning techniques. The project is designed to work with popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
#Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. It is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project. You will also need the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
Keras (high-level neural networks API)
Matplotlib (for plotting results)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
#Hardware Requirements
CPU: A multi-core processor (4+ cores) is recommended.
GPU: For faster training, a GPU (with CUDA support) is preferred.
RAM: At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended.
#Software Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Python Version: 3.x
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow (2.x) and Keras
#Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project as follows:

1. Prepare your Dataset: Place your images in a folder named data/ (or modify the path in the code).
2. Train the Model: Run the script to train the model on the dataset.
3. Evaluate the Model: After training, you can evaluate the model on test data.
4. Predict on New Images: To predict the class of new images.
#Models
The following deep learning models are implemented:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A simple multi-layer neural network for basic image classification tasks.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A more complex neural network specifically designed for image-related tasks, using convolutional layers for better feature extraction.
MobileNet: A lightweight neural network architecture optimized for mobile and embedded devices, using depthwise separable convolutions.
#Training
Dataset: The models are trained on the ImageNet dataset or a custom dataset. You can modify the dataset path and choose between various pre-built datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or your own.
Hyperparameters: The models are trained with default hyperparameters, which can be adjusted in the training script (train_model.py). You can tune the batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs based on the dataset and available hardware.
#Results
Once the model is trained, the accuracy, loss, and other metrics are saved and can be visualized using Matplotlib. The training process includes validation against a test dataset to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
